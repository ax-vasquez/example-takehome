## About my implementation

I ran out of time (timeboxed to 6 hours), but am overall happy with the implementation because it addresses the core functionality of the 
example application. My aim was to make sure my implementation at least addressed the core functionality, in pursuit of the "make it work,
then make it right" mentality.
